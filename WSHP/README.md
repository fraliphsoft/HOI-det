# Weakly and Semi Supervised Human Body Part Parsing via Pose-Guided Knowledge Transfer 

[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04310)]

Transferring human body part parsing labels to raw images by exploiting the anatomical similarity. Some transferred results:

These results are used as extra training samples for the parsing network and can improve the part segmentation results:
